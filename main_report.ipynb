        "For the batching component of our project, we developed a discrete-event simulator of a single-GPU LLM serving system to evaluate fixed-size and dynamic batching strategies. In fixed batching, the system dispatches requests once the queued token work reaches a target batch size b (or a timeout), while dynamic batching adapts batch size in real time to queue depth and applies a latency guard to prevent excessive waiting. We assessed both methods on throughput and key user-facing latency metrics: Time to First Token (TTFT), completion latency, and Time Between Tokens (TBT), which together capture responsiveness and streaming smoothness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across our sweep of fixed batch sizes (b = 32-256), throughput remained within a narrow range and was comparable to the dynamic baseline. This suggests batching has a greater influence on latency behavior than on raw capacity. Fixed batching with moderate or large b yielded tight, predictable completion latency and highly stable streaming (TBT concentrated in a narrow band). Dynamic batching often reduced average completion latency under light load but introduced greater token-level variability, leading to less consistent streaming. Overall, fixed batching offers steadier, more predictable performance once b is sufficiently large, while dynamic batching improves perceived responsiveness but can add jitter if not carefully tuned."

Token-level results were more decisive: fixed policies (especially b ≥ 64) generated the most consistent streaming cadence, while dynamic batching had a more dispersed TBT distribution, i.e., more jitter in inter-token gaps. Recommendation: if streaming consistency and predictable tails matter most, use fixed batching in the stable region; if responsiveness under light load matters most, dynamic can help but should be tuned to avoid frequent small dispatches that increase TBT jitter."

The system consists of one or more identical GPU workers, an input queue of queries, and a scheduler that batches and dispatches prefill and decode work. Each query undergoes a heavy prefill phase to construct the KV cache, followed by a decode phase that generates output tokens sequentially.\n",

By sweeping chunk sizes from 256 down to 8 tokens, we identify a clear “knee” in system behavior. Moderate chunk sizes (32-128 tokens) preserve high throughput and stable TTFT, while overly aggressive chunking significantly degrades TTFT, completion latency, and throughput. The results demonstrate that chunked-prefill improves fairness and head-of-line blocking only within a limited regime; excessively small chunks introduce repeated overheads and increased decode stalls that dominate performance."

A batch’s service time depends on its total token load 𝑏 through a piecewise-linear model S(b) = c + a max(0, b - b0), capturing a fixed per-batch setup cost and a marginal per-token cost beyond a threshold.

In each prefill iteration, a request can contribute at most chunk_size tokens, and the total token load of the batch is capped by a global token budget K  (set to 128). Prefill iterations may therefore include chunks from multiple requests. Once a request’s remaining prefill tokens reach zero, it becomes decode-ready. Decode iterations are also batch-based, with each active request contributing at most one decode token per iteration.\n",

Completion latency rises substantially, and throughput drops to 14.7-14.8 jobs per second, signaling a real loss in system efficiency rather than a simple fairness trade-off.\n",

With small chunks, long prompts require many more prefill iterations to complete, repeatedly incurring setup-like overhead and keeping prefill backlog persistently nontrivial.

Prompt length primarily affects TTFT through prefill blocking, while output length primarily affects TBT through decode congestion.
